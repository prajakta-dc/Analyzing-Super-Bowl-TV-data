# Analyzing-Super-Bowl-TV-data
We look at Super Bowl Data over past 52 years to generate insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows

We have three datasets as follows:
1. super_bowls.csv - Enlists superbowl statistics over last 52 years including winners, losers, difference between poinst of final teams etc.
2. tv.csv - Shows ad revenues, viewership, household share over time
3. halftime_musicians - Enlists Halftime performances by different musicians in each superbowl

Using the limited dataset, we analyze the relationship between increasing ad revenues and viewership. We also look at the way household share changes for blowout games vs close ones.
